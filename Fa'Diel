++ Fa'Diel ++

The name of my magical fantasy world but I can't decide if it's victorian times or modern times or a JRPG

---------

Kendahl

The main character and shes likes stuff

---------

Orion

Is a vampire who wears a plague doctors mask because his face is too beautiful for the world to see and they'd probably die from overexposure to sexiness

---------

Cecil

A pompous elitist brat, also likes snakes and makes a lot of snake puns

---------

Valentine & Destiny

Orion's twin sisters, they're fabulous

---------

Kai

A magician who loves the colour green. He has green hair, green eyes, and wears lots and lots of greens. Also likes emeralds

---------

Aki

Another magician who is the prince of boredom because he never show any expression at all ever. Never finishes a project. On a quest to serve the evilest villian but is never committed. Right now he serves Cecil
